# TIL

> Today I learned

A collection of random/make life easier things that I learn using a variety of languages and technologies. Most of these are so small I normally wouldn't write them down and then wonder how to do them at a later date. Honestly this is mostly for my own sanity but if you learn something along the way then great.

Based on and inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).
